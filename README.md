2. Student Grade Calculator
Description:
The Student Grade Calculator is a Java application designed to calculate the final grade of a student based on their scores in various subjects or assignments. The program takes input for individual grades and calculates the overall percentage, assigning a corresponding letter grade (e.g., A, B, C).
Features:
Accepts grades for multiple subjects or assignments.
Calculates the total percentage.
Assigns a letter grade based on the percentage.
Displays the final grade and percentage to the student.
